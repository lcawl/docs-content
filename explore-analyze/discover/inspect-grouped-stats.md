# Inspect grouped STATS results in Discover

When your {{esql}} query uses a [`STATS BY`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/stats-by.md) clause with a single grouping field, **Discover** displays the results as expandable groups instead of a flat table. Each row represents one unique value of the grouping field. You can expand it to inspect the underlying documents without leaving the query.

## Before you begin

- You need an {{esql}} query in **Discover**. If you're new to {{esql}} in Discover, start with [Get started with {{esql}} in Discover](try-esql.md).
- Your query groups by a single field, or by a single [`CATEGORIZE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/grouping-functions/categorize.md) call. Other queries keep the standard flat results table:
  - Queries that group by more than one field, for example `BY clientip, extension.keyword`.
  - Queries that use other grouping functions, such as `BUCKET` or `TBUCKET`.
  - Queries that use [`TS_INFO`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/ts-info.md) or [`METRICS_INFO`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/metrics-info.md). Their rows describe metrics and have no documents to expand.

## View grouped results from a STATS query [esql-cascade-layout]

1. In **Discover**, in {{esql}} mode, enter a `STATS BY` query with a single grouping field. For example:

   ```esql
   FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
   | STATS Visits = COUNT(*), AvgBytes = AVG(bytes) BY geo.dest
   | SORT Visits DESC
   ```

2. Select **Search**.

   **Result:** The table lists one row per group. The results count reports the number of groups instead of the number of documents.

   When you search large data sets, you can get faster, estimated results by using {icon}`bolt` **Fast mode**. Refer to [](/explore-analyze/query-filter/languages/esql-kibana.md#approximation-fast-mode).

3. Expand a row to inspect the underlying documents.

## Show CATEGORIZE patterns in the group titles [pattern-rendering]

When the grouping field uses [`CATEGORIZE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/grouping-functions/categorize.md), each row title shows the detected pattern with token highlighting, so you can scan repeated message structures at a glance.

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| STATS Count = COUNT(*) BY Pattern = CATEGORIZE(message)
| SORT Count DESC
```

::::{tip}
Pattern detection on text fields is also available outside {{esql}} from the **Patterns** view in Discover's classic mode. Refer to [](/explore-analyze/discover/run-pattern-analysis-discover.md).
::::

## Add sparklines to patterns [esql-cascade-pattern-sparkline]
```{applies_to}
serverless: preview
stack: preview 9.5
```

When the query also computes a [`SPARKLINE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/aggregation-functions/sparkline.md) over time, **Discover** renders an inline chart next to the row aggregates. For example, the following query categorizes log messages and renders a sparkline for each pattern:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| WHERE @timestamp >= ?_tstart AND @timestamp < ?_tend
| STATS Count = COUNT(*),
        Sparkline = SPARKLINE(COUNT(*), @timestamp, 40, ?_tstart, ?_tend)
    BY Pattern = CATEGORIZE(message)
| SORT Count DESC
```

On larger data sets, add a [`SAMPLE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/sample.md) command before `STATS` to keep the categorization fast, and divide `COUNT(*)` by the same sample fraction to keep the counts representative. For example, `SAMPLE 0.001` followed by `Count = COUNT(*) / 0.001`.

## Act on a grouped row [grouped-row-actions]

Select the {icon}`boxes_vertical` actions button on any group row to:

- **Copy to clipboard**: copy the group's value.
- **Filter in**: append a `WHERE` clause to your query that keeps only documents matching this group.
- **Filter out**: append a `WHERE` clause that excludes documents matching this group.
- **Open in new tab**: open the documents in this group in a new Discover tab, with a query scoped to that group.

**Filter in** and **Filter out** are disabled when the grouping field isn't filterable.

## Opt out of the grouped layout [opt-out-of-the-grouped-layout]

When the grouped layout activates, Discover replaces the regular results table toolbar with a {icon}`flask` **Group by** button. The button shows the number of active groupings as a badge.

Discover preselects the grouping field from your `STATS BY` clause. From the **Group by** menu, select **none** to go back to the standard flat results table and the regular toolbar.
