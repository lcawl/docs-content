# Use Discover with {{esql}}

{{esql}} mode in **Discover** lets you explore data with an {{esql}} query. The query sets the data, so you don't need a data view. Classic mode uses data views with Kibana Query Language (KQL) or Lucene.

For the editor itself, time parameters, AI assistance, and Fast mode, refer to [Use {{esql}} in the {{kib}} UI](../query-filter/languages/esql-kibana.md). If you haven't run a query in this mode yet, start with [Get started with {{esql}} in Discover](try-esql.md).
