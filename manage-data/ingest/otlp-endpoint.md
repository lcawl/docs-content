# {{es}} OTLP/HTTP endpoint

The {{es}} OTLP/HTTP endpoint is a native ingest API, like the [bulk API]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-bulk).
It accepts [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp) requests on the same host and port as the other {{es}} APIs, under the `/_otlp` path, and writes the records to data streams as they are received.
The endpoint does not run the [`elasticapm` processor](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/components/elasticapmprocessor.md) or [`elasticapm` connector](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/components/elasticapmconnector.md): traces are not enriched, no aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics are produced, and {{product.apm}} views that depend on them, such as the service inventory and service map, stay empty.

The intended client for this endpoint is a gateway Collector, not an application. How you send OpenTelemetry data to {{es}} depends on your deployment type:

* On {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, use the [{{motlp}}](opentelemetry://reference/managed-inputs/managed-otlp-endpoint.md) rather than `/_otlp`. The {{motlp}} is a separate ingestion host, and it enriches traces and produces aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics.
* On self-managed, {{ece}}, and {{eck}} deployments, send application data to an [{{agent}} in Gateway mode](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md#gateway-mode). The gateway runs the `elasticapm` processor and connector, then writes the enriched result to {{es}}, either to `/_otlp` or through the [{{es}} exporter](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/components/elasticsearchexporter.md).

The {{es}} OTLP/HTTP endpoint exposes three signal-specific paths:

| Signal | Path | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics | `/_otlp/v1/metrics` | {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2+` |
| Logs | `/_otlp/v1/logs` | {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5` |
| Traces | `/_otlp/v1/traces` | {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5` |

`/_otlp/v1/traces` stores spans as they are received: it does not run the `elasticapm` processor or connector, so traces ingested through it are not enriched and produce no aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics.

:::{important}
{{es}} only supports [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp), not [OTLP/gRPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlpgrpc).
:::

## When to use the {{es}} OTLP endpoint [when-to-use]

For most users, one of the following higher-level ingestion paths is recommended:

| Deployment | Recommended ingestion path |
| --- | --- |
| {{ech}} and {{serverless-short}} | [{{motlp}}](opentelemetry://reference/managed-inputs/managed-otlp-endpoint.md) |
| {{ece}}, {{eck}}, and self-managed | [{{agent}} in Gateway mode](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md#gateway-mode), which runs the `elasticapm` processor and connector before writing to {{es}} |

Use {{motlp}} if it's available in your deployment, even when an application can target the {{es}} OTLP endpoint directly.

For an overview of the recommended OpenTelemetry-based ingestion architecture, refer to the [{{edot}} reference architecture](opentelemetry://reference/architecture/index.md).

Use the {{es}} OTLP endpoint directly only in the following cases:

* You operate a self-managed OpenTelemetry Collector gateway that runs the `elasticapm` processor and connector, and you prefer the `OTLP/HTTP` exporter over the [{{es}} exporter](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/components/elasticsearchexporter.md) to send data from the gateway to {{es}}.
  The {{es}} exporter writes through the [bulk API]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-bulk) and the `OTLP/HTTP` exporter writes to `/_otlp`. Run the `elasticapm` processor and connector in the gateway pipeline before whichever exporter you choose.
* You build a development-only setup in which an application SDK sends OTLP data straight to the cluster.
  Traces sent this way are stored without `elasticapm` enrichment or aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics, so the {{product.apm}} views that depend on them stay empty.

:::{warning}
Don't send telemetry from applications or pods directly to `/_otlp`.
As with the [bulk API]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-bulk), each client opens its own connections to {{es}} and sends its own small batches.
Many direct clients mean many connections and many small requests, which {{es}} handles less efficiently than a few connections carrying larger batches.

Send telemetry to a gateway Collector or to the {{motlp}} instead.
A gateway Collector combines data from many clients into larger batches and writes them to `/_otlp` over a small number of connections.
This limit is about the number of connections to {{es}}, not the number of applications you monitor.
:::

## Advantages of OTLP ingest over Bulk API

Compared to the [bulk API]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-bulk), ingesting through OTLP offers:

* Improved ingestion performance, especially for payloads with many resource attributes.
* Simplified mapping: data streams, index templates, dimensions, and metrics are derived dynamically from OTLP metadata.
  There's no need to set them up manually.

## How to send data to the {{es}} OTLP endpoint

### Create an API key

Authenticate to the {{es}} OTLP endpoint with an API key.

On {{ech}} and {{serverless-short}}, send OTLP data to the {{motlp}} instead of to `/_otlp`, and authenticate with an API key as described in [{{motlp}} authentication](opentelemetry://reference/managed-inputs/managed-otlp-endpoint.md#authentication).

On self-managed, {{ece}}, and {{eck}} deployments, refer to the API key documentation for your deployment type for instructions on how to create one:

* [{{es}} API keys](/deploy-manage/api-keys/elasticsearch-api-keys.md) (self-managed, {{eck}})
* [{{ece}} API keys](/deploy-manage/api-keys/elastic-cloud-enterprise-api-keys.md)

The API key needs `create_doc` and `auto_configure` privileges on the data stream patterns it writes to.
`create_doc` allows writing documents without overwriting existing ones.
`auto_configure` allows the endpoint to create the target data streams on first write.

The minimum index patterns depend on which signals you ingest:

| Signals ingested | Required `names` patterns |
| --- | --- |
| Metrics | `metrics-*` |
| Logs | `logs-*` |
| Traces | `traces-*`, `logs-*` |
| All three | `metrics-*`, `logs-*`, `traces-*` |

Traces ingestion also writes span events to `logs-*` data streams, so it requires both patterns.

For example, an API key role descriptor that allows ingesting all three signals:

```json
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": ["logs-*", "metrics-*", "traces-*"],
      "privileges": ["create_doc", "auto_configure"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configure an OpenTelemetry Collector

To send data from an OpenTelemetry Collector to an {{es}} OTLP endpoint, configure the [`OTLP/HTTP` exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter):

```yaml
exporters:
  otlphttp/elasticsearch:
    endpoint: <es_endpoint>/_otlp
    headers:
      Authorization: "ApiKey <api_key>"
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      sizer: bytes <1>
      queue_size: 50_000_000 <2>
      block_on_overflow: true
      batch: <3>
        flush_timeout: 1s
        min_size: 1_000_000
        max_size: 4_000_000
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      exporters: [otlphttp/elasticsearch]
      receivers: ...
    traces:
      exporters: [otlphttp/elasticsearch]
      receivers: ...
    metrics:
      exporters: [otlphttp/elasticsearch]
      receivers: ...
```

1. Sizes the queue and batches by uncompressed bytes.
2. Limits the queue to 50 MB of uncompressed data.
   Increasing this value can absorb longer {{es}} outages or traffic bursts, but also increases Collector memory usage.
3. Controls the uncompressed batch size sent to {{es}}.
   In this example, batches are sent at 1 MB and capped at 4 MB.
   Larger batches reduce request overhead, but increase peak memory usage and the amount of data retried after a failed request.

The exporter appends the signal-specific path (`/v1/logs`, `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`) to the configured `endpoint`.

To ingest enriched traces and aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics, run the `elasticapm` processor and connector in the pipeline before this exporter, as [{{agent}} in Gateway mode](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md#gateway-mode) does.

These values are starting points for a gateway Collector.
Tune them for your workload and Collector resources.
They are local to each Collector instance and don't increase {{es}} ingest capacity.
If many applications need to send telemetry, scale out the gateway Collector instead of sending directly from each application.

Supported `compression` values are `gzip` (the `OTLP/HTTP` exporter default) and `none`.

In development-only setups, you can send data from a custom application by pointing the OTLP/HTTP exporter of an [OpenTelemetry language SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/getting-started/dev/) at the corresponding {{es}} OTLP endpoint path.
Traces sent this way are stored without `elasticapm` enrichment or aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics, so the {{product.apm}} views that depend on them stay empty.
In production, point SDKs at a gateway Collector or at the {{motlp}}.

:::{note}
Only `encoding: proto` is supported, which the `OTLP/HTTP` exporter uses by default.
:::

## Routing to data streams

By default, records are written to the following data streams:

| Signal | Default data stream |
| --- | --- |
| Logs | `logs-generic.otel-default` |
| Traces | `traces-generic.otel-default` |
| Metrics | `metrics-generic.otel-default` |

For more about how OTLP metrics are stored as time series data streams, refer to [Ingest metrics into a TSDS using the OTLP/HTTP endpoint](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/tsds-ingest-otlp.md).

The target data stream name follows the pattern `<type>-<dataset>.otel-<namespace>`.
You can influence `dataset` and `namespace` by setting attributes on your data:

* Set `data_stream.dataset` and/or `data_stream.namespace` as attributes.
  Precedence: data point or log record attribute, then scope attribute, then resource attribute.
* Otherwise, if the scope name contains `/receiver/<somereceiver>`, `data_stream.dataset` is set to the receiver name.
* Otherwise, `data_stream.dataset` falls back to `generic` and `data_stream.namespace` falls back to `default`.

Examples:

| Signal | Attributes or scope name | Target data stream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logs | `data_stream.dataset: nginx.access`, `data_stream.namespace: prod` | `logs-nginx.access.otel-prod` |
| Traces | `data_stream.dataset: checkout`, `data_stream.namespace: staging` | `traces-checkout.otel-staging` |
| Metrics | Scope name contains `/receiver/hostmetrics`, no `data_stream.*` attributes | `metrics-hostmetrics.otel-default` |
| Metrics | No matching attributes or receiver scope name | `metrics-generic.otel-default` |

## Configure histogram handling for metrics
```{applies_to}
stack: preview =9.3, ga 9.4+
```

You can configure how OTLP histogram metrics are mapped using the `xpack.otel_data.histogram_field_type` cluster setting.
Valid values are:

 - `histogram` (default on {applies_to}`stack: preview =9.3`): Map histograms as T-Digests using the `histogram` field type
 - `exponential_histogram` (default on {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+`): Map histograms as exponential histograms using the `exponential_histogram` field type

The setting is dynamic and can be updated at runtime:

```console
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "xpack.otel_data.histogram_field_type" : "exponential_histogram"
  }
}
```

Because both `histogram` and `exponential_histogram` support [coerce](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/coerce.md), changing this setting dynamically does not risk mapping conflicts or ingestion failures.

This setting only applies to metrics ingested through the {{es}} OTLP endpoint.
Documents ingested using the bulk API (for example through the {{es}} exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector) are not affected.

## Metric temporality
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.5
```

The OTLP endpoint preserves the [temporality](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/metric-temporality.md) of ingested metrics and stores it in a `temporality` [dimension](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/time-series-data-stream-tsds.md#time-series-dimension). This allows {{es}} to correctly interpret counter and histogram values during [ES|QL time series queries](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/metric-temporality.md#temporality-and-queries) and [downsampling](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/metric-temporality.md#temporality-and-downsampling).

The `temporality` dimension is set automatically based on the OTLP [AggregationTemporality](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#temporality) of each metric data point. No additional configuration is needed.

Note that cumulative temporality for histograms is only supported if `xpack.otel_data.histogram_field_type` is set to `exponential_histogram` (which is the default).

## Limitations

* **Trace enrichment and {{product.apm}} metrics:** The endpoint does not run the `elasticapm` processor or connector.
  Traces are stored as received, no aggregated {{product.apm}} metrics are produced, and the {{product.apm}} views that depend on them, such as the service inventory and service map, stay empty.
  For the full {{product.apm}} experience, send traces to the [{{motlp}}](opentelemetry://reference/managed-inputs/managed-otlp-endpoint.md) or through an [{{agent}} in Gateway mode](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/config/default-config-standalone.md#gateway-mode).
* **Delivery guarantees:** {{es}} can only acknowledge an OTLP request as a whole, not on a per-record basis.
  If part of a request fails, the client retries the entire batch, which can produce duplicate logs or trace spans.
  Metrics are not affected because metric points written to time series data streams are [deduplicated based on their dimensions and timestamp](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/time-series-data-stream-tsds.md#time-series-dimension).
* **Profiles:** Profiles are not supported.
  To ingest profiles, use a distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector that includes the [{{es}} exporter](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/components/elasticsearchexporter.md), such as [{{agent}}](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/index.md).
* **Exemplars:** Exemplars are not supported yet.
